## 2279\. Maximum Bags With Full Capacity of Rocks

Medium

You have `n` bags numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `capacity` and `rocks`. The <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> bag can hold a maximum of `capacity[i]` rocks and currently contains `rocks[i]` rocks. You are also given an integer `additionalRocks`, the number of additional rocks you can place in **any** of the bags.

Return _the **maximum** number of bags that could have full capacity after placing the additional rocks in some bags._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** capacity = [2,3,4,5], rocks = [1,2,4,4], additionalRocks = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

Place 1 rock in bag 0 and 1 rock in bag 1.

The number of rocks in each bag are now [2,3,4,4].

Bags 0, 1, and 2 have full capacity.

There are 3 bags at full capacity, so we return 3.

It can be shown that it is not possible to have more than 3 bags at full capacity.

Note that there may be other ways of placing the rocks that result in an answer of 3. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** capacity = [10,2,2], rocks = [2,2,0], additionalRocks = 100

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

Place 8 rocks in bag 0 and 2 rocks in bag 2.

The number of rocks in each bag are now [10,2,2].

Bags 0, 1, and 2 have full capacity.

There are 3 bags at full capacity, so we return 3.

It can be shown that it is not possible to have more than 3 bags at full capacity.

Note that we did not use all of the additional rocks. 

**Constraints:**

*   `n == capacity.length == rocks.length`
*   <code>1 <= n <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= capacity[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
*   `0 <= rocks[i] <= capacity[i]`
*   <code>1 <= additionalRocks <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>

## Solution

```kotlin
@Suppress("NAME_SHADOWING")
class Solution {
    fun maximumBags(capacity: IntArray, rocks: IntArray, additionalRocks: Int): Int {
        var additionalRocks = additionalRocks
        val len = capacity.size
        for (i in 0 until len) {
            capacity[i] -= rocks[i]
        }
        capacity.sort()
        var total = 0
        var i = 0
        while (i < len && additionalRocks > 0) {
            if (capacity[i] <= additionalRocks) {
                additionalRocks -= capacity[i]
                total++
            }
            i++
        }
        return total
    }
}
```
