## 406\. Queue Reconstruction by Height

Medium

You are given an array of people, `people`, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each <code>people[i] = [h<sub>i</sub>, k<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> person of height <code>h<sub>i</sub></code> with **exactly** <code>k<sub>i</sub></code> other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to <code>h<sub>i</sub></code>.

Reconstruct and return _the queue that is represented by the input array_ `people`. The returned queue should be formatted as an array `queue`, where <code>queue[j] = [h<sub>j</sub>, k<sub>j</sub>]</code> is the attributes of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> person in the queue (`queue[0]` is the person at the front of the queue).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** people = \[\[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]

**Output:** [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]

**Explanation:**

    Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
    Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
    Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
    Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
    Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
    Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** people = \[\[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]

**Output:** [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= people.length <= 2000`
*   <code>0 <= h<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>6</sup></code>
*   <code>0 <= k<sub>i</sub> < people.length</code>
*   It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.

## Solution

```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun reconstructQueue(people: Array<IntArray>): Array<IntArray> {
        return people.sortedWith(compareBy({ -it[0] }, { it[1] }))
            .fold(mutableListOf<IntArray>()) { output, p ->
                output.add(p[1], p)
                output
            }
            .toTypedArray()
    }
}
```
