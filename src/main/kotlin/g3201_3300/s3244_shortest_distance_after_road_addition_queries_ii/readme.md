## 3244\. Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries II

Hard

You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `queries`.

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Initially, there is a **unidirectional** road from city `i` to city `i + 1` for all `0 <= i < n - 1`.

<code>queries[i] = [u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the addition of a new **unidirectional** road from city <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> to city <code>v<sub>i</sub></code>. After each query, you need to find the **length** of the **shortest path** from city `0` to city `n - 1`.

There are no two queries such that `queries[i][0] < queries[j][0] < queries[i][1] < queries[j][1]`.

Return an array `answer` where for each `i` in the range `[0, queries.length - 1]`, `answer[i]` is the _length of the shortest path_ from city `0` to city `n - 1` after processing the **first** `i + 1` queries.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, queries = \[\[2,4],[0,2],[0,4]]

**Output:** [3,2,1]

**Explanation:**

After the addition of the road from 2 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 3.

After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 2.

After the addition of the road from 0 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4, queries = \[\[0,3],[0,2]]

**Output:** [1,1]

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/28/image11.jpg)

After the addition of the road from 0 to 3, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 3 is 1.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/06/28/image12.jpg)

After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path remains 1.

**Constraints:**

*   <code>3 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>1 <= queries.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `queries[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= queries[i][0] < queries[i][1] < n`
*   `1 < queries[i][1] - queries[i][0]`
*   There are no repeated roads among the queries.
*   There are no two queries such that `i != j` and `queries[i][0] < queries[j][0] < queries[i][1] < queries[j][1]`.

## Solution

```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun shortestDistanceAfterQueries(n: Int, queries: Array<IntArray>): IntArray {
        val flag = IntArray(n)
        val res = IntArray(queries.size)
        for (i in 0 until n) {
            flag[i] = i + 1
        }
        for (k in queries.indices) {
            val query = queries[k]
            val preRes = if (k == 0) (n - 1) else res[k - 1]
            if (flag[query[0]] >= query[1]) {
                res[k] = preRes
                continue
            }
            var subDis = 0
            var curr = query[0]
            while (curr < query[1]) {
                val next = flag[curr]
                subDis += 1
                flag[curr] = query[1]
                curr = next
            }
            res[k] = preRes + 1 - subDis
        }
        return res
    }
}
